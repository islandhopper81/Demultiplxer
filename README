Demultiplexer version 1.0.0

Demultiplexer provides a framework for demultiplexing frameshifted primers
frequently used in conjuction with molecule tags.  These frameshifted primers
allow for multiplexing of many more than samples than the standard 96 illumina
barcodes.  For more details about frameshifted primers, molecule tagging, and
processing molecule tagged data please see:
L<http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n10/abs/nmeth.2634.html>
L<https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-15-284>

Under the molecule tagging protocol, each well in a 96 well illumina barcoded
sequencing recation will have sequences with molecule tags of different lengths.
These different lengths (ie frameshifted primers) can correspond to different
samples.  This Demulitplexer object takes the all_categrizable_reads.fastq file
from the MT-Toolbox output and splits the reads into samples based on the
frameshifted primers.

There are important file provided by the user that are required for
demultiplexing with Demultiplexer.  For information about these files and other
required and optional parameters see the code documentation by typing the
following commands after a successful installation:

demultiplexer.pl --help
demultiplexer.pl --man
man Demultiplexer
man Demultiplexer::Param_Handler
